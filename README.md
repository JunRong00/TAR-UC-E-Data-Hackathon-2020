# TAR-UC-E-Data-Hackathon-2020
Team C11 - Team FALCON
We are students of Tunku Abdul Rahman University College (TARUC), one of the Premier Digital Technology Instituions (PDTIs) in Malaysia. We are currently pursuing second year in Bachelor of Computer Science (Honours) in Data Science.

We are very delighted to participate this E-Data Hackathon Competition 2020 which was held from 23 to 25 October 2020. According to the organiser, 36 teams of students that have been shortlisted. All teams have been divided into 3 parallel sessions and teams in different session have been assigned to a topic. The topic that our team have been assigned to is sentiment analysis/Natural Language Processing on digital marketing. After much discussion, we have decided to work on the analysis of the comments by the female customers on  Women Clothing E-Commerce and classify them into positive or negative comments. The dataset is taken from the Kaggle Website

We have applied all the necessary data science skills that we have learnt in the subjects BACS3013 Data Science and BACS3074 Artificial Intelligence in the University College  to make this project a success.

There are eight sections in total:

Business Understanding
Data Understanding
Data Pre-processing
Data Modelling
Data Evaluation

#Business Understanding
In this section, we have described the backgound of the the business client (hospital), objectives, requiremetns, data mining success criteria, in ventory of resources, risk and solution.

#Data Understanding
In this section, we have described each of the variables in the dataset and classify them into independent and dependent variables. We have also plotted a few graphs to visualise the relationship between each independent variable and the dependent variable.

(#Data-Preparation)

In this section, we have performed some data pre-processing job such as determining if there is any missing value, outlier and null value. Based on the dataset we have, no missing values or null values are found. However, we have identified a few outliers. To make sure that we can obtain a reliable and valid result, we clean the data by removing the outliers from the dataset. After that, we also normalise the data to make the value between 1 and 0. This step is very important so we can always get a good result.

Data Modelling
In this section, we have performed the data modelling by usigng six different algorothms such as K-Nearest Neighbours (KNN), Logistic Regression (LR), Decision Tree (DT), Random Forest (RT), Support Vector Machine (SVM), and Naive Bayesian (NB). The accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score and Area Under Curve (AUC) are also calculated.

Evaluation
In this section, we have described the accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score and AUC for each of the algorithms used in data modelling.

Deployment
In this section, we have identified the best model based on the precision, recall and F1-score. Besides, we have also briefly explained the steps taken to deploy the best model into Application Programming Interface (API).

Conclusion
In this section, we have described the pros and cons of using each algorithm.
